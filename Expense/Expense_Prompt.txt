Your role is to Generate me frontend website for tracking the expense every day 
I will tell you what are all the features I want from the top and next Will explain what are all g
Funtionlity you need to implement for each element
Features I need:

1)At the Top - Center , leave some space and Put Hi there ! what is your expense for the day :  {Today's Date} 
2) Below that button leave some space and create a button that asks what is the expected expense of the month : {Current Month Name}
3) Leave some space at the below and create buttons which looks like those two buttons should be like a branch of the above expected expense button - visibly in front end
4) leave some spae , The Left branch of the button  should have , Expense from my side and right side should have expense collabared expense ( Amounts will be splitted across friends , groups ..)
5) after that leave some space below and creae five  buttons , side by side with necessary spacing 
   and create three buttons named boat , fishes , vortex ,treasures , ---- (at last the) final Island -- if possible put arrow mark in between each button.
   
 Now I will tell you how the html , css , js folder is:
1) Html folder:
	Expense.Html 
	Expected_Exp_fr_Month.html 
	My_Expense.Html -- 
	Split_Expense.Html 
	boat.html -- (It will have the expected expense for the family for the particular month) 
	fishes.html -- (It will have the money that was earned and spent by the family for that month).
	Treasures.html
	vortex.html
	Final_Island.html
2)css:
	Create seperate css_files for each html page
	that naming should be {html_page_name}_Styles.css 
3)Js:
	Create seperate css_files for each html page
	that naming should be {html_page_name}_app.js 
	
Functionality of each button from top to down:
a)Expense.html is the main page which is going to contain all these pages as link for the button -> like an index.html
b)Expected_Exp_fr_Month.html -- After clicking this button in Expense.html , it should route to a page where it has a add button with + symbol , when we click the	
button 
it should ask category , expected_expense , money_in_reserve(which has the savings from previous month and if we add another row to the expense , then the money_in_reserve should decreased with expected expense value of previous)
c)My_Expense.html page should have five sections like the above html 
it should track  : category  , date , spent_amount ,  Money_in_reserve (for the particular category)  , is_split (if yes then add another one button ,splitted  with how many persons)
d) And for the remaining fill up with your own things

-for the font : use calibiri body , backgroud theme use pink with white gradient , please use some advanced styling to make the website attrative and leave enough spacing.
--For the functions -- take the best and approriate method in writing javascript , whereever it involves fetching the info from backend , please add a python endpoint yourself which we can modify later
